## Main goals

- I've no idea what kind of game it would be ;)
- level entirely generated from .tmx (TiledMap Editor) map file (including templates and tilesets)
- use Lua as scripting language (I plan to use scripts that would be attached to various objects in the game)
- some graphics improvements
